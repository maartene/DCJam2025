## Story
You breached the first level of security. Now its you job to hack through the next 10 levels of security.
What is there to find? The answer to the ultimate secret: what came before? the chicken of the egg?
### Themes: 
    - hacking fits a **heist** setup well, get loot. also, literally hacking a firewall could be fun :)
    - treasure hunting: fake walls? secrets on maps?
### Restriction:
    - The secret to find is the answer to the question what came first, the chicken or the egg.
